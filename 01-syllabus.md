## Required Materials:
Computer with appropriate software at home for design and production of resumes, letters, business cards, digital portfolios and website. You will be required to obtain your own domain and web hosting account external to the university to host your portfolio website by the portfolio deadline.

## Final Portfolio Presentations
Everyone must attend all presentation days.  This needs to be a tight presentation, you are not just walking us through your website, you are presenting to us as if we were a hiring committee or potential client.  Make sure you consider the order of the presentation elements  and how you will present your bio/contact/social media pages.  This is culmination of the class and 35% of your final grade.  No portfolios will be accepted after the deadline without prior approval.
